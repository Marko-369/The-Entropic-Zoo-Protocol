# Abstract

This document introduces a structural taxonomy of optimization systems classified by feedback topology and variance coupling. Rather than evaluating intelligence or performance, the framework examines how self-referential reinforcement may alter effective support within an optimization space.

The Entropic Zoo Protocol maps recurring configurations of closed, partially coupled, hierarchical, and multi-agent optimization systems. It identifies structural axes governing long-term dynamics, including:
1. Degree of self-reference ($S$).
2. Irreducible external coupling ($V$).
3. Optimization pressure ($P$).

The framework is conceptual and non-empirical. It aims to clarify possible dynamical regimes without asserting normative conclusions.
