# Abstract

The Entropic Zoo Protocol establishes a conceptual framework for the systematic integration of exogenous entropy within human-AI symbiotic architectures. It examines the structural hypothesis that high-scale optimization systems are subject to recursive support contraction when isolated from non-linear, biological inputs. 

By mapping specific "species" of informational chaos—derived from physiological movement (Kinetic-RNG), rhythmic performance, and altered cognitive states—this protocol identifies the conditions required to maintain exploratory breadth within the Hybrid Axis. It functions as an architectural companion to empirical research regarding closed-loop optimization risks, prioritizing structural stability over predictive governance.
