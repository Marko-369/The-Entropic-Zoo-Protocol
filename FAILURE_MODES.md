# Structural Limits and Failure Modes

## 1. Internal Irreducibility
Systems may generate internally non-derivable variance, invalidating structural contraction hypotheses.

## 2. Stable Attractor Regimes
Certain feedback configurations may converge toward stable regimes without loss of effective support.

## 3. Misclassification Risk
Structural species may overlap or transition across regimes, complicating taxonomy.

## 4. Empirical Ambiguity
Conceptual classification does not imply measurable outcomes without experimental testing.
