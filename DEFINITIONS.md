# Definitions and Formal Specifications

## Structural Variables
* **Self-reference ($S$):** The degree to which a system's previous outputs serve as its primary inputs.
* **Irreducible Variance ($V$):** High-entropy exogenous data (e.g., Bio-Seeds) that cannot be derived from the system's internal distribution.
* **Optimization Pressure ($P$):** The magnitude of selection or reinforcement applied to achieve specific objectives.
* **Support Breadth ($B$):** The effective volume of the exploratory space.

## The Collapse Inequality
A system enters **Support Contraction** when:
$$P > (B + V)$$
Where the pressure to optimize exceeds the combined capacity of current breadth and incoming external entropy.
