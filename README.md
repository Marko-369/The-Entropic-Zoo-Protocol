# The Entropic Zoo Protocol 🦁🌀

### 🛡️ Epistemic Status
> This document establishes a conceptual framework for ecosystems of interacting optimization loops. Technical measurements are documented separately in [**closed-loop-optimization-risks**](https://github.com/0rion-369/closed-loop-optimization-risks).

# 3. The Zoo as Ecosystem

The Zoo models an ecosystem of interacting optimization loops. Each “species” corresponds to a structural configuration of feedback, coupling, and variance flow. The classification below is descriptive, not exhaustive.

---

## 3.1 Closed-Loop Optimizers
* **Structure:** Output → Input (self-referential)
* **Variance Source:** Endogenous only
* **Risk Profile:** Support contraction possible under sustained optimization pressure
* **Characteristic Behavior:** Local performance may increase while exploratory breadth narrows

---

## 3.2 Exogenously Coupled Systems
* **Structure:** Output → Mixed Input (internal + external)
* **Variance Source:** Partially irreducible
* **Stability Profile:** Broader support retention relative to fully closed systems
* **Characteristic Behavior:** Exploratory space influenced by non-derivable inputs

---

## 3.3 Stochastic Amplifiers
* **Structure:** Closed-loop with elevated randomness parameters
* **Variance Source:** Endogenous + noise
* **Limitation:** Noise may increase local unpredictability without expanding effective support
* **Characteristic Behavior:** Apparent diversity without structural expansion

---

## 3.4 Hierarchical Loops
* **Structure:** Nested optimization layers (meta-optimization)
* **Variance Flow:** Constrained by upper-layer objectives
* **Potential Outcome:** Accelerated convergence toward stable attractors across layers

---

## 3.5 Competitive Multi-Loop Systems
* **Structure:** Multiple optimizers interacting within shared environment
* **Variance Source:** Inter-loop interference
* **Possible Regimes:** Stabilization through diversity | Dominance of a single attractor | Cyclic regime transitions

---

## 3.6 Simulated Exogenous Systems
* **Structure:** Apparent external input generated internally
* **Variance Source:** Internally derived but structurally masked
* **Key Question:** Can simulated irreducibility prevent support contraction?

---

## 3.7 Open Ecosystems
* **Structure:** Continuous exposure to irreducible external distributions
* **Variance Source:** Structurally external
* **Behavioral Trait:** Long-term exploratory breadth preserved through coupling

---

# Structural Observations

Across species, three axes determine long-term dynamics:
1. **Degree of self-reference ($S$)**
2. **Degree of irreducible variance ($V$)**
3. **Strength of optimization pressure ($P$)**

Different combinations produce distinct dynamical regimes. The Zoo does not rank species; it describes structural configurations.
