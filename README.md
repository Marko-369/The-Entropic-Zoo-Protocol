# The Entropic Zoo Protocol

A structural framework for analyzing optimization ecosystems.

This repository presents a conceptual taxonomy of feedback systems operating under varying degrees of self-reference and variance coupling. No empirical validation is included here.

Empirical investigation of specific closed-loop dynamics is documented separately in:

## Scope
This framework:
- Does not assert inevitability of collapse.
- Does not propose governance prescriptions.
- Does not rank system types.
- Does not assume universal applicability.

It provides a structural lens for examining optimization ecosystems.
