# Origin and Method

The framework emerged from structural reasoning about long-horizon optimization dynamics. Formalization followed initial intuition, not the reverse.

### Development Constraints:
- Independence from specific architectures.
- Avoidance of implementation bias.
- Minimal formal structure sufficient for classification.
